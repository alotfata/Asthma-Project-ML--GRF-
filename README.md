# ML Regression Models (Ongoing study)


This study aims to predict asthma prevalance in the united states at county level- 
The study compares four ML regression modesl to predict asthma prevalance
Mulilinear regression - Polynomial regression- Randforest regression and support vector regression 
non-spatial model results shows the highest prediction on Test data is polynomial regression with adjusted r square of 0.68
random forest 0.65 
support vector and multiliner regresssion= 0.58 
We dont need to make it as weighted regression adding spaatial lag should make it unique study.
